## Tools

### Overlay

If you would like to help us place Tux, we highly recommend you use our Overlay! It's a [userscript](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) that runs through a [browser extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension) that will render an image on top of the r/place canvas showing incorrect pixels:

![Overlay example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/main/overlay/example.png)

Installation instructions:

1. Install the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) addon/extension on your browser:
    - [Firefox-based](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/violentmonkey)
    - [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) (Opera extension for [CWS compatibility](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/))
    - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)
3. Install [the user script](https://r-placetux.github.io/place_tux/userscript.user.js)

For troubleshooting regarding the Overlay see [here](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/overlay), or ask us directly on Discord / Matrix / Telegram.

### Tux with Coords

If you prefer not to use the Overlay, you can find an expanded image with coordinates attached [here](https://r-placetux.github.io/place_tux/tux_coords.png).

## More information

Our canvas corners:

```
(20,679)  (71,679)
(20,758)  (71,758)
```
### Canvas Size?

Ideally we would take up the entire 2000x1000 canvas for ourselves, but that would make other communities sad... And it's also impossible. We would create 3 progressively larger pixel arts (a 50x50, a 75x75 and a 100x100 version) for Tux and Distro/DE. We would draw the appropriate one in r/place, based on territory gained.

## Why should I use Linux?

#### It respects your freedom and privacy.

- You can see every line of code it uses, so you can be sure there is no backdoor or keylogger. (The NSA tried 3 times to get a backdoor into linux, but failed)

#### It runs on older computers, saving them from the landfill.

- It is very fast and lightweight.

- It costs exactly $0

#### It's yours.

- **_EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF LINUX_** can be modified however you want, and is only limited by hardware.

- It can look real sexy (take a look at [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn/)).

- You don't have a giant, monopoly, money-seeking company forcing you to do what it thinks is best for you, making you the product (I'm looking at you Microsoft and Apple...)

- Many, many options to choose from and to customize your system as you see fit.

- You get to brag about how smart you are when a Windoze user sees you "hAcKIng" (I use Arch btw).

#### It's powerful and secure.

- The command line is really good and lets you do very complex things in one line, while user-friendly graphic interfaces work well for those that don't want to use commands.

- Package managers make installing software a breeze, and always from a verified malware-free source.

- It's almost impossible to get a virus in Linux ([meme](https://twitter.com/pr0grammerhum0r/status/1252341297479741442)).

- **_TONS_** of support for Linux: ask a question, and in a few minutes people will be responding.

- Countless other reasons.
