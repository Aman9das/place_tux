Our Canvas stretches:

```
(20,679)        (71,679)

(20,758)        (71,758)
```

## Tools:

The https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/Overlay tool helps detect wrongly colored pixels and suggest the correct colour. Restart the browser after installation of the extension.

## Strategy:

Help ward off any forces approaching us and fix any logo being vandalised.

## Priorities!

- [x] Create Canvas Border

- [x] Create Tux Border

- [x] Draw GNU/LINUX Text

- [x] Draw Distro Logos

- [x] Color Tux

- [x] Clean the Area

- [ ] Defend the Canvas

# **_THE FINAL DECISION ON ART HAS BEEN MADE_**

We will be using the picture named **_GloriousOfficialFinal51x79FlatTux.png_** (made by 8Miles8). And we will be drawing it at around the same place like 2017, but to the left side of the canvas, to avoid r/TheBlueCorner. So mid-left, not too close to the center, or the edge. **_NOTE THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE UNCHANGING AND FIXED!_**

## The Git Repo for [r/placetux](https://reddit.com/r/placetux) on [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place)

We aim to plan out and draw Tux and a few Distro/DE logos in the Reddit r/place event.

### How to create Pixel Art?

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4MWAj6ukm0) gets you started with creating pixel art on Krita. Alternatively, you can use any other pixel art editor (such as Aseprite, Libresprite, Pixelorama, Lospec, Pixilart, Piskel), even GIMP, and be sure to **_EXPORT IT_** into a PNG file, into their respective folders. Be sure to also use the correct palette, that is located at root (palette.png). **_Stick to the PNG files already there! Don't add more!_**

### Canvas Size?

Ideally we would take up the entire 1000x1000 canvas for ourselves, but that would make other communities sad... And it's also impossible. We would create 3 progressively larger pixel arts (a 50x50, a 75x75 and a 100x100 version) for Tux and Distro/DE. We would draw the appropriate one in r/place, based on territory gained.

### Why should I use Linux

#### It respects you freedom and privacy.

- You can see every line of code it uses, so you can be sure there is no backdoor or keylogger. (The NSA tried 3 times to get a backdoor into linux, but failed)

#### It runs on older computers, saving them from the landfill.

- It is very fast and lightweight.

- It cost exactly 0$

#### Its yours

- **_EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF LINUX_** can be modified to however you want, and is only limited by hardware.

- It can look real sexy (take a look at r/unixporn).

- You don't have a giant, monoply, money-seeking company forcing you to do what it tells you to do, making you the product (im looking at you Microsoft and Apple...)

- Many, many options to choose from, to customize it.

- You get to brag about how smart you are when a Windoze user sees you "hAcKIng" (I use arch btw).

#### Its Powerful and secure.

- The command line is really good and lets you do very big things in one line.

- Package managers make installing software a breeze.

- It's almost impossible to get a virus on it, and there are still antiviruses for it.

- **_TONS_** of support for Linux, ask a question, and in a few minutes people will be responding.

- Countless other reasons.
