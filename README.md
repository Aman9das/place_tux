# The Git Repo for [r/placetux](reddit.com/r/placetux) on [r/place](reddit.com/r/place)
We aim to plan out and draw Tux and a few Distro/DE logos in the r/place event

### How to create Pixel Art?
This video gets you started with creating pixel art on Krita: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4MWAj6ukm0

### Canvas Size?
Ideally we would take up the entire 1000x1000 canvas for ourselves, but that would make other communities sad. We would create 3 progressively larger pixel arts (a 50x50, a 75x75 and a 100x100 version) for Tux and Distro/DE. We would draw the appropriate one in r/place, based on territory gained.
