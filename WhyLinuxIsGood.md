# Why linux is best

## It respects you freedom and privacy.

- You can see every line of code it uses, so you can be sure there is no backdoor or keylogger. (The NSA tried 3 times to get a backdoor into linux, but failed)

## It runs on older computers, saving them from the landfill.

- It is very fast and lightweight.

- It cost exactly 0$

## Its yours

- ***EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF LINUX*** can be modified to however you want, and is only limited by hardware.

- It can look real sexy (take a look at r/unixporn).

- You don't have a giant, monoply, money-seeking company forcing you to do what it tells you to do, making you the product (im looking at you Microsoft and Apple...)

- Many, many options to choose from, to customize it.

- You get to brag about how smart you are when a Windoze user sees you "hAcKIng".

## Its Powerful and secure.

- The command line is really good and lets you do very big things in one line.

- Package managers make installing software a breeze.

- It's almost impossible to get a virus on it, and there are still antiviruses for it.

- ***TONS*** of support for Linux, ask a question, and in a few minutes people will be responding.

- Countless other reasons.
